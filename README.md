# Unearth

A mobile world exploration app.  Unearth encourages exploration of the world with friends by giving the user a world map that is covered in fog.  Using GPS, the fog on the map will clear away as the user moves around the world, revealing where they've been.  Friends can reveal the same map together and even drop custom markers for each other on the map.  Re-explore the earth with Unearth.

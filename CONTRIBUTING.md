### Commits
When you're writing commits, try to organize them into smaller parts containing related changes.  Keep commits in the present tense ("adds" rather than "added").

* Please title commits with any of the following tags and a succinct summary of the change:
  * [feature] - For adding a new feature
  * [test] - For adding tests
  * [doc] - For editing documentation, comments
  * [bugfix] - For fixing a bug
  * [refactor] - for re-organizing and cleaning up code or files.
  * [remove] - for removing code or files


* Follow the title with " - " as bullet points for any further information we'll need about the commit.
